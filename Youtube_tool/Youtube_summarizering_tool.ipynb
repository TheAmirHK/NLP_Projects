            "But quantum systems, by nature, are fragile, and the information they hold hides from us. Feynman concluded that classical computers just can't scale up fast enough to keep pace with the growing complexity of quantum calculations. This means that we need to talk about what’s at the heart of quantum physics: a concept called amplitudes. Here’s what the classical rules of probability tell us about getting tails if we toss a coin 20 times. A bit is binary—it stores information in strings of binary digits that can only be 0 or 1. But if you want to describe very highly entangled states using ordinary bits, it's extremely expensive. To describe this entangled configuration with a classical computer, you’d need 16 kilobytes, or 16 thousand bits. Expand to a system with 500 entangled qubits, and you now require more classical bits than there are atoms in the known universe. This is exactly what Feynman meant when he said that classical computers weren’t scalable for simulating quantum mechanics. Now, whether that's going to make anybody any money—whether there'll be practical applications in the near-term—that's still very much an open question.\n"
