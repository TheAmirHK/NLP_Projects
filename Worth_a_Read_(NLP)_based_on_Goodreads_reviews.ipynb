And Kingsolver does a great job crafting Demon Copperhead's voice, making the resourceful boy (and later young man) sound witty, empathetic, and engaging, infusing his whole vibe with some and . Of course we're also dealing with an important topic, and Kingsolver is here to give the overlooked and left-behind a voice - but this is where the problem starts.\n",

            "I am not at all saying that a successful, famous writer is generally unable to convey what it means to be a person like destitute Demon in the rural South, it just doesn't work very well in this particular text, and the reason can be found in the plot itself: While Kingsolver has a lot of empathy for her characters and is obviously very upset about the societal situation - this book is rooted in her impetus for change -, everything that happens to Demon is already present in the readers' preconceived notions of socially unstable, \"backwards\" Appalachia: Teenage single mom with substance abuse issues who dies?

This unchallenging outrage activism, no matter how well-intentioned, has a tendency to be patronizing and to serve as a narcissistic tool of moral self-assurance. It's, to put it bluntly, intellectually lazy, and it certainly does not help to show people from Appalachia in a new, more nuanced light - on the contrary: It only tells us what we already believe to be true.\n",

When a novel relies so heavily on widespread notions and then adds clichéd narrative devices (of course Demon, in the most classic of all classic motifs, is also an artist; and there is the tragic twist; and a football coach; and the good-hearted grandmother, ... *argh*), it becomes rather annoying, especially because this novel is way, way, way too long.

I would be hesitant, however, to make any further comparisons because for me that puts a contemporary novel on shaky ground when setting it next to a classic, beloved book. I can somehow forgive Charles Dickens for his verbosity. After all, that was the vogue back in his day. was a series of installments, stretched out over a period of time. He didn’t get paid by the word but by installment; still, he had a lot of mouths to feed. Barbara Kingsolver, on the other hand, could have done with a lot less, and I would have been a much happier reader for it. That’s not to say that her points are less important than Dickens’ themes.

However, I still couldn’t get the author out of my head while reading this story - despite the fact it was supposedly told through a young boy-turned-young adult’s point of view. I’ve read and loved some of Kingsolver’s earlier work but have had difficulty with more of her “recent” work for the same reason. If I sense the writer sitting next to me on the couch while I read, I get a little cranky. I would much rather feel like his or her characters are having a nice heart to heart with me instead.

In these Appalachia stories, I’ve often found that the women are the ones holding down the fort.

            "A retelling of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, in a contemporary Southern Appalachian setting, by is a powerful work of fiction. Part coming of age, part social commentary, the narrative revolves around the eponymous Demon Copperhead, born Damon Fields, (named after his father Damon, who died from an accident before his birth, earning the nickname “Copperhead” on account of his copper wire hair) to an addict mother in a trailer park in Lee County, Virginia. We follow Demon from his childhood through his early adulthood, as he grapples with poverty, loss, abuse, loneliness, and short-lived moments of hope and success as a young athlete with college dreams before an injury derails his plans and his struggle with addiction and substance abuse. Narrated in the first person by Demon, as he shares his perspective on the people and events that shape his life and his worldview, this is a story of grief, resilience and ultimately the search for a sense of belongingness and the will to survive when the odds are stacked against you.\n",

Barbara Kingsolver not only paints the picture of the lives of those caught up in a vicious cycle of poverty, neglect and addiction, the Opioid Crisis in particular but also takes a grim look at issues such as parental negligence, child abuse and the foster care system among others. The characterizations are superb and the author skillfully weaves a large cast of distinctive characters into the narrative without it becoming overwhelming or too difficult to follow. The author also addresses how outsiders harbor certain preconceived notions about certain communities without totally understanding the challenges they face.\n",

Kingsolver is good at both seriousness and playfulness, as Dickens was, and she cares deeply about backwoods, rocky Virginia. This works for me, too- I never lived in Appalachia, but I have deep family roots in West Virginia, and I care about that part of the world. I got invested in young Demon (a nickname for Damon) quickly and cared about him all the way through. Even when he makes awful mistakes in this book, he’s a loving person, and I think his worst mistakes are made out of love. He’s good at making connections with people who might save him, too, and he’s generous with the people in his life even when things are unbelievably hard. I like how Demon, even when he’s going through something terrible, notices and is buoyed by the beauty of the natural world. The sense of place is strong in this book. The characters are even stronger, and you care about them deeply as they suffer in the eye of the opioid storm that still wracks our country. I’ve read almost all of Kingsolver’s books, and I think this has replaced The Poisonwood Bible as my favorite. As always when I’m truly loving a book, I worried about the ending. Would the author stick the landing? I am haunted by the ghosts of a few books that just lost it at the end. But she stuck the landing! I love where the book ends.\n",

His father died before his birth, and Demon inherited his father's good looks and flaming red hair (Copperhead). His mother remarried a vile, abusive, violent man.

Then he is moved to the McCobbs, sleeping in a dog's room, and expected to earn money by working outside the home to supplement the family's income.

The mountains of Lee County come alive through her beautiful descriptions. But it was somewhat disappointing to see every possible stereotype about the locals make its way into this book. This is somewhat ironic because Demon tells us multiple times how he feels upset about the stereotypes outsiders have about his people, and then he goes on to live a life reiterating every single cliché through his own deeds, which sounds even worse when heard in first person. Drugs, alcohol, sex, cuss words, poverty, physical violence, domestic violence, social backwardness, racial discrimination ,… you name it and it is there in this book. I am not going to remark on how much of this might be based on reality as I have no first-hand experience of that culture and hence have no right to judge. But from the way it was portrayed, I got hardly any good vibes about the community, and that it is a sure sign that only hackneyed ideas were being thrown at us.\n",

Demon Copperhead cannot use the era as an excuse. As it is a retelling, I am also taken aback by the amount of vulgarity in the story.

While his mother struggles with drug addiction and is in and out of rehab, Demon is also cared for by the kindly Peggot family next door, grandparents bringing up their own grandson whose mother is in prison. He learns to love the wild forests, to hunt and fish and what it’s feels like to be part of a large family. However, when he is ten, Demon’s world really falls apart when his mother marries an abusive man with no interest in raising a child. This is the start of a downhill spiral for Demon that leads to the nightmare of foster care, where he is expected to work to earn his keep, never given enough to eat or provided with bigger clothing as he grows. After he hits his lowest point, a change in fortune will find him in a better place but, with a baggage of neglect, abuse and poverty, he’s not equipped to weather the storms still to come and is in danger of repeating the cycle of addiction and poverty.\n",

This is a long book and I did find it slow down in the latter half when Kingsolver is fully laying out the causes and effects of the opiod crisis in America, particularly in marginalised populations, such as in poor rural areas where there is high unemployment and people are told they are worthless. However, sad and depressing Demon’s story is, it felt very real and hopefully will lead to better understanding of what it is to be caught up in poverty through no fault of your own, poorly educated and without hope and told you are worthless, with the lure of drugs one way to make it all go away for a while.

            "This work is a modern retelling of Dickens’ David Copperfield, though since it’s been so long since I’ve read the original, I can’t say exactly how heavily the original work is referenced in this read. I enjoyed that it utilizes and explores the same themes (generational poverty and trauma, class, etc.) but was set in Kentucky. I had mixed feelings about the portrayal of the people and struggles of the area, though. It felt like the author picked everything bad that could happen in the poorer areas of the Appalachians and forced them all into Demon’s life, leaving no room for any sort of positive portrayal. There’s a fine line between realism and sensationalism, and I think the author strayed too far the wrong way. Although this is generally what Dickens’ did with his works, that was two centuries ago and I’d hoped a modern retelling might be a little more well-rounded and a little less stereotypical. I think as long as folks don’t read this and assume that this is what life is like in the Appalachians, it will be okay.\n",

I also think the author did a good job with the atmosphere and incorporating the setting. I did find at times that the work became repetitive or unnecessarily detailed, causing my interest to lag a bit.\n",

            "I truly hope that this book will give Kingsolver the Pulitzer that she deserved in 1999 for The Poisonwood Bible. Demon is a fabulously imperfect protagonist and his David Copperfield-type story is moving and utterly human. I mean, this could have been an incredibly boring book if it tried to follow Dicken's too much and without enough skill, but that didn't happen. It could have been a rubbernecker trainwreck of a novel with a voyeuristic view of addiction and teen sex and it avoided that too. Instead, it just gives us a uniquely vulnerable protagonist who we follow from becoming an orphan to losing it all to gaining it all back piece by piece and then losing it all again and hitting rock bottom. The Pilgrim's Progress of Demon works also to dispel some of the more common and negative stereotypes about \"mountain people\" by at least explaining the economic and pharmacological background in which they live. It is also a fantastic indictment of the oxy wars on the American poor of the late 90s and early 00s (and ongoing today). I loved Aunt June and was in love with both Emily and Agnes/Angus, heartbroken over Matthiew/Maggot, and disgusted with U-Haul, Fast Forward, and Stoner.

Ms. Kingsolver told a group that on the final leg of her previous book tour, she and her husband were in England where they had booked a room in an inn that was the home of Charles Dickens. Because they were the only guests, they had free reign of the inn. Ms. Kingsolver tells how she sat in Dickens' study and at his desk. It was here that she knew what her next book would be. She says that in questioning how she would formulate her book, Charles Dickens imparted to her to write the story in the voice of the child, to let the child tell the story.

            "Kingsolver has created a very particular world, inhabited it with people you can’t forget, and coerced from me an emotional investment that I’m not often willing to make in fiction. You can talk about substance abuse, poverty, domestic violence, assault, the foster care system, and ineffective social services without turning an already misrepresented population into sideshow freaks. Narrated entirely by Demon – his strength of character, enduring, resilience spirit, and ability to find humour in any situation that was thrown at him, made this an unforgettable read. Show more Tragic and heartbreaking The story takes place mostly in southern Appalachian Lee County, Virginia where Demon (Damon) was born to a teen mother with addiction. Show more Update: This book did win Kingsolver her long-awaited Pulitzer (along with Hernan Diaz’s Trust) so, for the first time, I made a good guess :-)\n"
